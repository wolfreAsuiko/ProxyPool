Texas Chainsaw 3D is a film that will appeal to fans of the horror genre who enjoy watching gruesome killings and jump scares. It is not a film for the faint-hearted or those who expect a coherent plot or character development. It is a film that pays homage to one of the most influential horror films of all time, while adding some modern twists and effects.
  
The film begins with a recap of the events of the original film, in which a group of friends are attacked by the Sawyer family at their farmhouse. The sole survivor, Sally Hardesty, escapes and alerts the authorities, who arrive at the scene and find the corpses of the victims. A vigilante mob of enraged locals surrounds the house and sets it on fire, killing every member of the family except for an infant girl who is secretly rescued by one of the mob members.
 
Decades later, the girl has grown up to be Heather Miller (Daddario), a young woman living in New York City. She receives a letter informing her that she has inherited a mansion in Texas from her grandmother Verna Carson, whom she never knew existed. She decides to travel to Texas with her boyfriend Ryan (Sipos), her best friend Nikki (Raymonde), and Nikki's boyfriend Kenny (Keram Malicki-SÃ¡nchez). Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker named Darryl (Trey Songz), who claims to be looking for work.
 
When they arrive at the mansion, they are greeted by Farnsworth (Richard Riehle), a lawyer who gives Heather a letter and a key from her grandmother. He warns her not to go into the basement, where he has locked something for her protection. Heather ignores his advice and opens the basement door, unleashing Leatherface (Yeager), the disfigured and deranged son of the Sawyer family who survived the fire and was hidden by Verna. Leatherface kills Darryl with his chainsaw and escapes into the woods.
 
Heather reads the letter and learns that she is actually the daughter of Loretta Sawyer, one of Leatherface's sisters who was killed by the mob. She also learns that Leatherface is her cousin and that Verna wanted them to be reunited as a family. Heather is shocked and disgusted by this revelation and decides to leave the mansion with her friends. However, they soon find themselves hunted by Leatherface, who wants to kill them for trespassing on his territory.
